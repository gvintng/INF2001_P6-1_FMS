# Ferry Management System (FMS)

## Project Description
Balancing an employee’s workload is always challenging and a sensitive topic in the workplace. With the ever desire to improve work-life balance and make the workplace environment more conducive and attractive (Guest. 2002), companies are often looking for tools that can ease their workload management as work-life balance is a cycle (Lupu & Ruiz-Castro, 2021). 

As a result, your client (your instructors) has decided that a workload management system on the Web would be an informative way to have an overview of the company’s manpower strengthen at any time and get more informative availabilities of employees and engagement. 

The system is expected to provide an interactive and visual way for the employee to see their job assignments, working hours engaged/assigned, and for employees to inform the system of their availabilities. Employees should be able to indicate to the company any assigned jobs they cannot fulfil ahead of time. To assist with the workload planning, employees should be able to indicate their availabilities up to one month earlier. 

The administrative staff (usually the manager) should be able to visualise the manpower availability at any time up to one month earlier. Hence, the system is expected to provide an interactive and visual way for the administrative staff to visualise manpower availabilities, job assignments, and allocate jobs. Individual employee workload and availabilities should be able to be visualised at a glance.

### The Company
In the ferry’s cabin crew division, work allocation is assigned weekly every Monday. The workload
allocation planning will start every Thursday of the week. Hence, all employee’s availabilities must
be informed in the system every Wednesday to be considered in the planning. If employees miss the
weekly deadline, requests would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

The weekly roster is dependent on the route assigned. Currently, the fleet consists of twenty-six
ferries. On all routes, minimally, a ferry captain and two crews must be assigned. The captain is a
licensed mariner who has overall command and control of the navigation, manoeuvring, stowage,
communications, and safe handling of the ship. The crew is to serve the passengers, keep the ferry
clean and tidy, and assist the captain in stowing and safe handling of the ship. It will help if you
consider that the manager will make their assignments such that staff should not need to travel
between routes. Ferries should not be left stationary for more than two hours as far as possible to
maximise profits.

Currently, the ferry company operated between four routes.
- HarbourFront Centre, Singapore and Batam Centre, Indonesia (8 times a day bidirectional)
- HarbourFront Centre, Singapore and Sekupang, Indonesia (3 times a day bidirectional)
- HarbourFront Centre, Singapore and Tanah Merah, Singapore (every 2 hours)
- Tanah Merah, Singapore and Bandar Bintan, Indonesia (4 times a day bidirectional)
